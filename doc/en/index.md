    title: Approachable
    details: Easier to get started. As long as you are basically familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can get started directly. We can declaratively describe the relationship between the final output HTML and JavaScript states. Developers can focus more on the development of business logic and do not need to care too much about the details of DOM operations.

    title: Fast
    details: Blazing Fast Virtual DOM. Adopts the virtual DOM mode. The virtual DOM uses the diff algorithm to calculate the nodes that really need to be updated, minimizing DOM operations and the typesetting and redrawing losses caused by DOM operations. This significantly improves performance.

    title: Flexible
    details: Flexible manipulation of code blocks. A function is a component, which can be arbitrarily combined according to the size of the application. And the unique "island feature" of the component allows the level of virtual DOM tree calculation to be controlled at the component level.
