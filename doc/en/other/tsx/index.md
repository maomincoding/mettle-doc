# TSX Support

We can not only write Mettle using JSX syntax, but also using TSX syntax.

- TSX combines the type checking function of TypeScript, which can capture type errors at compile time, reduce runtime errors, and improve code reliability.
- TypeScript's smart prompts and auto-completion functions are still valid in TSX, helping developers write code faster and reduce spelling errors.
- Type annotations and interface definitions make code easier to read and maintain, especially in large projects, which can significantly reduce maintenance costs.

## Use

[createMettleApp](/tool/createMettleApp/) The project scaffolding tool is installed by default, just select the `mettle-ts` or `mettle-apps-ts` template.
